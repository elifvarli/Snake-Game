# Python Turtle Snake Game

Dive into the classic Snake game with a modern twist! This Python project brings the nostalgic gameplay of the traditional Snake game right to your desktop. Using the Python Turtle Graphics library, players control a snake, guiding it to food while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail. With each piece of food consumed, the snake grows longer and the game becomes more challenging. Are you ready to beat your high score?

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive Controls**: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake across the screen.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of your current score and your highest score.
- **Automatic Speed Adjustment**: The snake's speed increases as it consumes food, raising the difficulty level.
- **Collision Detection**: Game resets when the snake hits the wall or its own tail.
- **Persistent High Score**: The game saves your highest score between sessions.

## Prerequisites

Before you start playing the Snake game, you'll need:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- The Python Turtle Graphics library (comes pre-installed with Python).

## Setup

1. **Clone or download the repository** to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## How to Play

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
3. Run the game with the command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Use the **arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)** to control the snake's direction.
5. Guide the snake to the yellow food. Each piece of food consumed increases your score and the length of the snake.
6. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
7. The game resets if the snake collides with the wall or itself, but your high score will be saved.

## Customization
